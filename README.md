## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Selectors
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- The major learning from this project is use of CSS selectors. If you take a look at the stylesheet you will see that I havent used a single id or class to select an element
- This project helped me getting better at Flexbox and Units of CSS.
- There is also a bit use of Transition and Transform.

### Continued development

I would like to invest a little more time on Flexbox to gain a perfect hand on it. For that I am planning to make few more projects weekly. Also I would like to work more on Transition and Transform.
